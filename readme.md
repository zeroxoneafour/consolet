# NOTICE - Consolet has been remerged with [inspectlet](https://github.com/zeroxoneafour/inspectlet), so this repo has been archived

### consolet
Inspectlet was very broken, so I'm remaking it here. This is only the console, but it is powerful enough to do anything Inspectlet could.

Usage - Save the text inside consolet.txt as a bookmark, then use the bookmark while on a web page to open up a JavaScript console.
